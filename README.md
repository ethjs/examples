## About

This is a small set of dApps and apps using `ethjs`. Each example is meant to demonstrate correct usage of `ethjs` modules, namely, the [`ethjs`](http://github.com/ethjs/ethjs) module.

Many of these examples use `ethereumjs-testrpc` to simulate an Ethereum node running in the browser. This is meant to get you up and running with Ethereum, so configuration is kept to a minimum. Once you feel ready to go to an actual node or client, please use any one of the available nodes or clients listed below.

## Libraries Used

  - [TestRPC](http://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) - An entire Ethereum node simulator written in Javascript
  - [ethjs](http://github.com/ethjs/ethjs) - A simple JS utility library for Ethereum

## Enable Metamask Support

Once your ready to go live on the Ethereum `mainnet` or `testnet`, simply add this script to make your dApp to make it MetaMask ready (note every example has this script commented off by default, simply uncomment it to enable support).

```js
if (typeof window.web3 !== 'undefined' && typeof window.web3.currentProvider !== 'undefined') {
  eth.setProvider(window.web3.currentProvider);
} else {
  eth.setProvider(provider);
}
```

## Help out

There is always a lot of work to do, and will have many rules to maintain. So please help out in any way that you can:

- Create, enhance, and debug ethjs rules (see our guide to ["Working on rules"](./github/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
- Improve documentation.
- Chime in on any open issue or pull request.
- Open new issues about your ideas for making `ethjs-schema` better, and pull requests to show us how your idea works.
- Add new tests to *absolutely anything*.
- Spread the word.
